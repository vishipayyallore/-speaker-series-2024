## 1. The Big Picture

> 1. Discussion

## 2. Copilot for Web

> 1. Conversational AI Chatbot powered by Bing
> 1. Powered by Open AI's GPT-4 LLM. Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer
> 1. **Chat GPT-4** is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. It builds upon its predecessors, incorporating improvements in architecture, training data, and fine-tuning techniques. Chat GPT-4 is capable of understanding context, generating coherent responses, and assisting users across a wide range of tasks, making it a powerful tool for natural language understanding and generation. Its underlying neural network architecture, based on transformer models, allows it to handle complex language patterns and relationships, making it a valuable asset for various applications in text generation, chatbots, and more
> 1. **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an artificial intelligence algorithm that employs neural network techniques with a large number of parameters to process and understand human languages or text using self-supervised learning. These models are highly efficient in capturing complex entity relationships in text and can be used for tasks like text generation, machine translation, chatbots, and more. LLMs operate on the principles of deep learning, leveraging neural network architectures and attention mechanisms to learn intricate patterns and relationships from diverse language data during training. Examples of LLMs include Chat GPT by OpenAI and BERT by Google
