## DAPR (Distributed Application Runtime) from 30,000 foot

Dapr is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless, and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks. It is created by Microsoft with an open source approach and it is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (`CNCF`) incubated project.
